# <Password-Generator>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to apply adveanced skills, knowledge, and tools learned on class about JavaScript.
- I built this project primarily with the intention of applying the basic JavaScript knowledge i got from class on things like arrays, variables, functions, conditional statements, for loops, while loops among other things to create a Password generator that adapts to the users input on wheter or not they want to have upper or lower case letters, numbers, and or special characters.
- The code was created to show the use of a variety of Javascript properties to succesfully provide functionality to a password generator.
- I learned how to properly use JavaScript, through trial an error, google research, study groups, and tutoring I was able to come up with the expected result
